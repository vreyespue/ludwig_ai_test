            "hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. what else can you ask for in a film? this is my all-time, number one favorite movie. ever since i was a little girl, i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble.<br /><br />the clich\u00e9 characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst (harold) and andy tennant (melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the movie. and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of flynch? don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies, dressed up as hari krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! the clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless.<br /><br />a word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. but nevertheless give it a chance, you may find that \"it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you've gotta play.\"",

            "this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. it's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.<br /><br />it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer- beat the clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome. then it rewards the winner money. if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. <br /><br />this show has elements of several types of successful past programs. reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. if your not, this entire series is as i say, drivel dripping with gravy. it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.<br /><br />it is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet. after all, so do re-runs of gilligan's island, green acres, the beverly hillbillies & the brady bunch. this just doesn't employ professional actors. the intelligence level is about the same.",
            "you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years, right? i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).<br /><br />and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable. it's just hard to suspend disbelief for \"bushy bill\" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy.<br /><br />what's the appeal here? i don't care about these people or their meandering lives. i just don't get it. but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy, unwashed people, i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat. they call them homeless people, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking \"pay-dirt\" and fashioning a homemade dr. frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of \"aqua velva\" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. and the best part? much like survivor, every week one member of the tribe \"leaves\" the \"island\" when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear! now that's entertainment!",
            "this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. sure, the effects are laughable, the story confused, but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun. i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in, it added to what little suspense was mustered. give it a 3.",
            "why did i have to go out and buy (yes buy!) jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman??? maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost. it was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george. that and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). so i thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? well, i was so dead wrong! <br /><br />let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. i mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? as much as i love the premise, i really hated the movie. first of all: while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. it has this way too slick shot-on-video look. the lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). the acting... well don't even go there. the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that jamaican man was just moronic, saying \"man\" after every sentence). and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all i could think of was a seventh-rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.<br /><br />the best joke was were one guy asks \"why are you talking to your watch?\". and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. but the worst thing about this movie was: where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. a lot of people were killed off in original ways here, but all off-screen. like i've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the dvd) wasn't even in the movie. i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning i didn't see sh!t!). i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then i get to see nothing?!?! what a let-down! could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie? that would be a shame, 'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. they made munchies look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. but i guess that was the whole point of it. at some point, the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi. boy, you really have to see it to believe it. best is to not see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too bad (okay, i did laugh with it, for it kept getting worse and worse). just stick with the first jack frost (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).<br /><br />it's funny, but writer/director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2, and then focused on writing. turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside (starring ryan phillippe) and identity (starring john cusack). so the man seems to have some talent after all.<br /><br />now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible. so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. way to go mr. cooney!",

            "i agree with \"johnlewis\", who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved, i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating.<br /><br />examples : <br /><br />pierre is going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin-y ? <br /><br />pierre and his stepmother have a rather...curious relationship.<br /><br />pierre, lucie, and thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain...<br /><br />lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch, or is he ? <br /><br />and isabelle, who is she really ?? <br /><br />overall, i think it was worth my time. an interesting film, and one that makes me want to read melville.",
            "i enjoyed carax's \"les amants du pont neuf\" and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard. well, the first 10 minutes were ok, but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life. a sad disappointment.",
            "i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'gone with the wind' should ever have been undertaken. having expressed that, i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood. i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe.",
            "i like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's . i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana , n.w.a , public enemy , soundgarden etc .the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it .see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project",
            "for all the homicide junkies out there, this movie was great! every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie. it helped to resolve some (but not all) issues from the series. unfortunately, unless you actually did watch the series, most of the enjoyment would be lost, as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence. this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie, but we gotta take what we can get. i hope they make more movies, and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order.",
            "the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in. people come looking for a b-grade horror film, or a \"so bad it's good\" movie. jack frost 2 is neither of these.<br /><br />it is, to put it simply, a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one. to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy (easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless \"scary movies\" combined) is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level. it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions.<br /><br />the premise is simple; the characters from the first movie, haunted by memories of jack frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. a new, improved jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of hydro-man from spider-man; essentially, he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly, divide himself, multiply himself, and, worst of all, he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness...antifreeze.<br /><br />what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost (a simply horrible movie) can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action, jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre.<br /><br />most of the entertainment comes the live action actors, who serve admirably. particularly funny among them are ray tooney (playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s), christopher allport (offering an insane, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and david allen brooks (taking the once serious role of manners to new, totally bizarre heights).<br /><br />the lack of \"memorable quotes\" disturbs me.<br /><br />as a horror movie, jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman, rates a zero. but you have to understand, it's not a horror movie.",
            "\"witchery\" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when linda blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts. the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady \u0096 an aging actress or something who always dresses in black \u0096 starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of \"the evil dead\". the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.",
            "okay, i'll say it. this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy. i mean, did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece? just look at the \"scary\" hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer. instead, like the original jack frost (which i thought was just as funny), this movie turned out to be a side-splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue, bad one liners and horrible special effects. and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. it certainly worked for me.<br /><br />for example: anne tiler (to her troubled husband): what makes you frown so heavily darling?<br /><br />if that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh, then you have serious issues. who in their right mind would utter those words in real life? of course, no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous! just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2.",

            "before i begin, let me get something off my chest: i'm a huge fan of john eyres' first film project: shadowchaser. the film, a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).<br /><br />judge and jury begins with joseph meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called \"bloody shootout\" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree \u0096 meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her \u0096 michael silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). but once executed, meeker returns as a revenant (or as kelly perine calls \"a hamburger without the fries\"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making silvano's life a misery.<br /><br />let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film. it is a supernatural action film, with meeker chasing silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator, a french chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle), to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife.<br /><br />director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. but that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. the acting is surprisingly good, with keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by kove, as well as paul koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.",

(cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story. avoid this movie at all costs, folks. it's not even an interesting train wreck.

            "i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot. frankly, i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie. i was wrong. the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walker's beautiful wailing voice. the film explores the identity crisis of pierre (guillaume depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and his consequential (self-)destruction. the story is divided into two parts \u0096 the first depicts pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed half-sister. both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography \u0096 the first very colorful and bright, the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic - adding up to a true aesthetic feast. pola x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.",

            "before i begin, let me get something off my chest: i'm a huge fan of john eyres' first film project: shadowchaser. the film, a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).<br /><br />judge and jury begins with joseph meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called \"bloody shootout\" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree \u0096 meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her \u0096 michael silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). but once executed, meeker returns as a revenant (or as kelly perine calls \"a hamburger without the fries\"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making silvano's life a misery.<br /><br />let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film. it is a supernatural action film, with meeker chasing silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator, a french chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle), to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife.<br /><br />director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. but that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. the acting is surprisingly good, with keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by kove, as well as paul koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.": 2,

            "how much do i love this film?! now i'm not a fan of bad films, but i do love a film that is so bad it's good. this is one of those. juan pablo di pace has a great butt, looks fab on screen, and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut (i believe). billy zane is suitably mean and moody, though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him. i felt it in titanic, the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example, totally broken, shocked, and put-down ... fierce! kelly brook is a pretty face ... no seriously, i think that's it! it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy, some big bra fillers from brook, nasty growling from billy, laugh at the dialogue, revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair ... i'm gona go watch it again now - yes, i bought it!!!": 2,
            "i agree with \"johnlewis\", who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved, i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating.<br /><br />examples : <br /><br />pierre is going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin-y ? <br /><br />pierre and his stepmother have a rather...curious relationship.<br /><br />pierre, lucie, and thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain...<br /><br />lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch, or is he ? <br /><br />and isabelle, who is she really ?? <br /><br />overall, i think it was worth my time. an interesting film, and one that makes me want to read melville.": 2,
            "i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'gone with the wind' should ever have been undertaken. having expressed that, i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood. i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe.": 2,
            "i and a friend rented this movie. we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging. the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending. we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.": 2,
            "i enjoyed carax's \"les amants du pont neuf\" and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard. well, the first 10 minutes were ok, but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life. a sad disappointment.": 2,
            "i find it rather useless to comment on this \"movie\" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it. but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... <br /><br />filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian \"movie\" directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called \"romanian reality\" following the communist era (1990 to present days).<br /><br />under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others (who lately find amateurish camera, lack of plot, lack of directorial / actors's quality etc, noise etc. as being trendy and even art-like) : watch & enjoy this \"movie\" (as i know you will) but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor, don't write an online review for it will misguide, irritate and in the end waste their time.<br /><br />on the other hand this movie (among others) has some value whatsoever, an educational one for it sets the example for : \"how not to make a movie.\"": 2,
            "i found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.<br /><br />the dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?<br /><br />it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. the stereotypes and jokes about \"men's groups\" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. as it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.<br /><br />apart from the attractive irish man - this film was a dud. and not even in a \"so bad it's good way\". the last 20 minutes were particularly painful. perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before, then this film might have something meaningful to say. otherwise - darlings, you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing.": 2,

            "i like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's . i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana , n.w.a , public enemy , soundgarden etc .the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it .see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project": 2,
            "i read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it. i'm a big francophile and art film lover, but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something \"arty\" or \"intellectual\" into something it is not. i will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never, ever wanted to actually see. obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. the film is, in essence, disgusting. i mean, when i saw requiem for a dream, i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film.": 2,

            "i see that c. thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.<br /><br />i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older c. thomas howell is; i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.<br /><br />in just a few words: what a very big disappointment. i give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a chatroom. they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat, she then insists on meeting the participant in person. she meets him, has sex, ties him up and then murders him in cold blood. the plot then deteriorates further.<br /><br />the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff. do not bother renting it much less purchasing it, even if it is in the $1 dvd bin. i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill. i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.": 2,
            "i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot. frankly, i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie. i was wrong. the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walker's beautiful wailing voice. the film explores the identity crisis of pierre (guillaume depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and his consequential (self-)destruction. the story is divided into two parts \u0096 the first depicts pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed half-sister. both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography \u0096 the first very colorful and bright, the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic - adding up to a true aesthetic feast. pola x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.": 2,
            "i'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this. however, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. it's definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdism.<br /><br />the animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. the main character is foul mouthed, violent, and stupid. no redeeming qualities whatsoever. his wife shrieks and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point.<br /><br />but again, that's the point ;)<br /><br />if non sequiters, foul language, and complete and utter randomness are your thing, you're going to love this.<br /><br />it is really short, so i would probably rent instead of buying.": 2,

            "it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad.. the acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution. it was completely unoriginal. o, and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger! <br /><br />one of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. if they were hoping for a career relaunch, then i think it might never happen with this on their cv! the script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />i'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.": 2,

            "just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. take mike myers, for example. he's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his snl days, over ten years ago. he's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. his cat is painfully unfunny. he tries way to hard. he's some weird type a comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. the rest of the movie is just as bad. the sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story. avoid this movie at all costs, folks. it's not even an interesting train wreck.

(w=waste).<br /><br />take for example: about two dozen fbi & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. inside the jeep is ma and is \"confused\" as to why all the cops are about. within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, ma being killed straight off. the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.": 2,

            "the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to john woo's masterful direction, coupled with kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before (tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, i didn't even recognize him at first). sammo's goofy \"buck teeth\" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. jackie chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way. tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.": 2,

            "the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in. people come looking for a b-grade horror film, or a \"so bad it's good\" movie. jack frost 2 is neither of these.<br /><br />it is, to put it simply, a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one. to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy (easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless \"scary movies\" combined) is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level. it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions.<br /><br />the premise is simple; the characters from the first movie, haunted by memories of jack frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. a new, improved jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of hydro-man from spider-man; essentially, he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly, divide himself, multiply himself, and, worst of all, he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness...antifreeze.<br /><br />what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost (a simply horrible movie) can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action, jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre.<br /><br />most of the entertainment comes the live action actors, who serve admirably. particularly funny among them are ray tooney (playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s), christopher allport (offering an insane, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and david allen brooks (taking the once serious role of manners to new, totally bizarre heights).<br /><br />the lack of \"memorable quotes\" disturbs me.<br /><br />as a horror movie, jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman, rates a zero. but you have to understand, it's not a horror movie.": 2,

            "this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the \"night gallery\" show back in 1971. the episode starred sue lyon (of lolita movie fame) and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively. the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night for blood. the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. she bolts out the door, the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over. i don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes. they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. a total wasted effort.": 2,

            "why did i have to go out and buy (yes buy!) jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman??? maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost. it was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george. that and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). so i thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? well, i was so dead wrong! <br /><br />let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. i mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? as much as i love the premise, i really hated the movie. first of all: while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. it has this way too slick shot-on-video look. the lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). the acting... well don't even go there. the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that jamaican man was just moronic, saying \"man\" after every sentence). and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all i could think of was a seventh-rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.<br /><br />the best joke was were one guy asks \"why are you talking to your watch?\". and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. but the worst thing about this movie was: where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. a lot of people were killed off in original ways here, but all off-screen. like i've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the dvd) wasn't even in the movie. i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning i didn't see sh!t!). i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then i get to see nothing?!?! what a let-down! could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie? that would be a shame, 'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. they made munchies look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. but i guess that was the whole point of it. at some point, the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi. boy, you really have to see it to believe it. best is to not see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too bad (okay, i did laugh with it, for it kept getting worse and worse). just stick with the first jack frost (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).<br /><br />it's funny, but writer/director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2, and then focused on writing. turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside (starring ryan phillippe) and identity (starring john cusack). so the man seems to have some talent after all.<br /><br />now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible. so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. way to go mr. cooney!": 2,

            "\"witchery\" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when linda blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts. the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady \u0096 an aging actress or something who always dresses in black \u0096 starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of \"the evil dead\". the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.": 19,

            "before i begin, let me get something off my chest: i'm a huge fan of john eyres' first film project: shadowchaser. the film, a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).<br /><br />judge and jury begins with joseph meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called \"bloody shootout\" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree \u0096 meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her \u0096 michael silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). but once executed, meeker returns as a revenant (or as kelly perine calls \"a hamburger without the fries\"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making silvano's life a misery.<br /><br />let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film. it is a supernatural action film, with meeker chasing silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator, a french chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle), to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife.<br /><br />director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. but that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. the acting is surprisingly good, with keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by kove, as well as paul koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.": 44,

            "the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to john woo's masterful direction, coupled with kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before (tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, i didn't even recognize him at first). sammo's goofy \"buck teeth\" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. jackie chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way. tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.": 61,
            "the monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like \"miner's massacre\" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity.": 55,
            "the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub. she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal. the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.": 39,
            "the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in. people come looking for a b-grade horror film, or a \"so bad it's good\" movie. jack frost 2 is neither of these.<br /><br />it is, to put it simply, a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one. to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy (easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless \"scary movies\" combined) is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level. it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions.<br /><br />the premise is simple; the characters from the first movie, haunted by memories of jack frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. a new, improved jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of hydro-man from spider-man; essentially, he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly, divide himself, multiply himself, and, worst of all, he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness...antifreeze.<br /><br />what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost (a simply horrible movie) can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action, jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre.<br /><br />most of the entertainment comes the live action actors, who serve admirably. particularly funny among them are ray tooney (playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s), christopher allport (offering an insane, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and david allen brooks (taking the once serious role of manners to new, totally bizarre heights).<br /><br />the lack of \"memorable quotes\" disturbs me.<br /><br />as a horror movie, jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman, rates a zero. but you have to understand, it's not a horror movie.": 18,
            "there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. first of all, let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. cat was... well, just awful.<br /><br />jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.<br /><br />why, why, why mike myers?? the kids could care less, and the austin powers demographic isn't going to spy this film. so, what was the studio thinking?<br /><br />the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond. can we talk? why a new york accent? not entirely consistent with anything dr. seuss has ever written. myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick. i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said \"as long as you don't say fahklempt', you can keep the accents.\" meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, make-up, or dialogue.<br /><br />the jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate. when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: \"dirty ho\", everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn't have helped.<br /><br />the same folks who created 'whoville', clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat'. the sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and myers.<br /><br />there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston. dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr. seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre.<br /><br />call the spca. this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. please, please, no sequel.": 46,
            "this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. sure, the effects are laughable, the story confused, but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun. i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in, it added to what little suspense was mustered. give it a 3.": 8,
            "this has to be my guilty pleasure. i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone. this move has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provoking scenes. just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown, then so be it! this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think. viva la nudity!": 66,
            "this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy-mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow; the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.<br /><br />alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.<br /><br />this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.": 32,

            "this movie was a rather odd viewing experience. the movie is obviously based on a play. now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch. the movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie. instead what is presented now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play, with over-the-top characters and staged dialog. because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience.<br /><br />it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching. at first you think its a drama you're watching, with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy, that leans really more toward the comedy genre, rather than the drama genre.<br /><br />the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable. sure, the actors are great; peter o'toole and susannah york, amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough'.<br /><br />the story feels totally disorientated. basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york. but what exactly is the story even about? the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. like i said before; i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out.<br /><br />the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences. <br /><br />more was to expect from director j. lee thompson, who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed, stage-play translated to screen, project.<br /><br />really not worth your time.<br /><br />4/10": 62,

            "this soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years, eastenders is the prime example. for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf, the thug, the wide-boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually-incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ...<br /><br />how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders \"mirrors life\"? life on which planet, exactly? <br /><br />it's written about \"working-class\" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing. eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the \"working-class\" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders.<br /><br />this has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of walford.<br /><br />thus, it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders.<br /><br />other soaps have followed in ee's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly. this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash. the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output, and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves. meanwhile, the burgeoning number of new, tv-induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy.<br /><br />and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room. it's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison.": 43,
            "this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the \"night gallery\" show back in 1971. the episode starred sue lyon (of lolita movie fame) and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively. the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night for blood. the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. she bolts out the door, the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over. i don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes. they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. a total wasted effort.": 60,
            "when i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. i watched then with very low expectations. now this movie isn't bad per se. you get what you pay for. it is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. definitely not a hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. i would probably never watch this movie again. in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. despite the bad acting, clich\u00e9 lines, and sub par camera work. i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player. the story has been done many times in many movies. this one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /><br />just your average movie.": 4,
            "where to begin, i like the scary snow-monster named jack frost. the whole concept works well for me, we thought he'd be back and he was. changing the local to a tropical resort works. seeing old friends and meeting new characters. scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost, you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. yup, jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first. i do have one complaint, the little jacks or the jacklings as i call them. they looked like hand puppets. i think they could have done a better job with the jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. if you liked jack frost, then you will like this sequel. no questions or debate, 9 big stars.": 34,
            "why did i have to go out and buy (yes buy!) jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman??? maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost. it was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george. that and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). so i thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? well, i was so dead wrong! <br /><br />let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. i mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? as much as i love the premise, i really hated the movie. first of all: while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. it has this way too slick shot-on-video look. the lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). the acting... well don't even go there. the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that jamaican man was just moronic, saying \"man\" after every sentence). and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all i could think of was a seventh-rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.<br /><br />the best joke was were one guy asks \"why are you talking to your watch?\". and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. but the worst thing about this movie was: where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. a lot of people were killed off in original ways here, but all off-screen. like i've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the dvd) wasn't even in the movie. i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning i didn't see sh!t!). i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then i get to see nothing?!?! what a let-down! could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie? that would be a shame, 'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. they made munchies look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. but i guess that was the whole point of it. at some point, the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi. boy, you really have to see it to believe it. best is to not see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too bad (okay, i did laugh with it, for it kept getting worse and worse). just stick with the first jack frost (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).<br /><br />it's funny, but writer/director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2, and then focused on writing. turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside (starring ryan phillippe) and identity (starring john cusack). so the man seems to have some talent after all.<br /><br />now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible. so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. way to go mr. cooney!": 9,
