            "hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. what else can you ask for in a film? this is my all-time, number one favorite movie. ever since i was a little girl, i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble.<br /><br />the clich\u00e9 characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst (harold) and andy tennant (melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the movie. and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of flynch? don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies, dressed up as hari krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! the clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless.<br /><br />a word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. but nevertheless give it a chance, you may find that \"it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you've gotta play.\"",

            "i thought rachel york was fantastic as \"lucy.\" i have seen her in \"kiss me, kate\" and \"victor/victoria,\" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. she is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!<br /><br />i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in \"lucy.\" even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy. my response to that is, \"so what?\" i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy. i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. and rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. i also didn't want to see someone simply \"doing\" classic lucy routines. therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory. (it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). this approach, i thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping, in particular. there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having. i couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.<br /><br />i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of \"i love lucy\" throughout the entire movie. after all, those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years. i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.<br /><br />i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon. and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. \"lucy\" was a star turn for rachel york. i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. i also hope it brings her an emmy.",
            "well, the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid. if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you. a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness. i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless. the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. the plot, however, has little to recommend. a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people. but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. not recommended.",
            "i have some great memories watching \"robin of sherwood\" on tv as a kid (but i think i only saw michael praed\u00b4s episodes, by some reason). and recently my brother bought the new released dvd-boxes of the complete series. it was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv-series. the cast is great, and the locations mixed with clannad\u00b4s music adds this very special feeling. i personally think that praed is the best of the two robins, but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with. ray winstone, nicolas grace and robert addie is terrific in their roles as will scarlet, the sheriff of nottingham and guy of gisburne. it\u00b4s a pity that a fourth season never got made, and i\u00b4ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. robert of huntingdon (connery) could finally have married marion (judi trott), or maybe herne the hunter could resurrect robin of loxley (praed), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. as have been mentioned before; if the producers of \"robin hood: the prince of thieves\" would have been smart, they would have got the cast from \"robin of sherwood\", and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. as ray winstone puts it in the dvd bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in sean connery\u00b4s \"robin and marian\". who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. in any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!",

            "this film is bundled along with \"gli fumavano le colt... lo chiamavano camposanto\" and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints. first, both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. second, neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though \"il prezzo del potere\" does seem to have a better dub. personally, i always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. these dvd problems, however, are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.<br /><br />as for the film, it's about the assassination of president garfield. this is a major problem, as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland. in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield. he's missing the beard, has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this, i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes. plus, using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho!! he was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.<br /><br />in addition to the stupid casting, president garfield's death was in no way like this film. it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk, not garfield. garfield was shot in washington, dc (not dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. however, according to most experts, what actually killed garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. in other words, like george washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed president garfield was shot.<br /><br />because the film bears almost no similarity to real history, it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. why not also include ninjas, fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it?!?! aside from some decent acting and production values, because the script is utter cow crap, i don't recommend anyone watch it. it's just a complete and utter mess.",

            "hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever cannonite review show. my movie for this week was debatable, what route what movie, what excellent four star epic would i choose, guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route, i've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept. the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman. the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam tiller, eileen seeley as anne tiller, marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners, sean patrick murphy as captain fun, ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost.<br /><br />it's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost(loved the carrot scene),but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast. the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced. what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie?the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder. sam tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original, his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie. his wife however was one of the few bright spots. she played her role as the main woman to a hilt. she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy. the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given. if it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chucky,freddy and jason. laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk, he had humor, and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak.<br /><br />this movie could have been so much more, it could have been a continuation of a great franchise, instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled.<br /><br />this movie gets a two out of ten for me, and it's lucky that it even gets a one.",
            "the unthinkable has happened. having first witnessed it a few years ago, i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called \"mccinsey's island\". a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones (i'm not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. however, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump \"guest house paradiso\" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch.<br /><br />based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show \"bottom\", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. richard (rik mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. his buddy eddie (director adrian edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. the plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina carbonara (vincent cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso, much to the astonishment of richie and eddie. and... that's it.<br /><br />i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. we've had films like \"trainspotting\", \"28 days later\", \"four weddings and a funeral\" and the brilliant \"shaun of the dead\" (also starring simon pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. \"guest house paradiso\" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. i kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. come the first ad break (it was on tv, you see) and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. \"i'm watching this so they don't have to\" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.<br /><br />trust me, i used to love the \"bottom\" tv show. the combination of suitably grubby acting from mayall and edmondson with ott juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. certainly not for an hour and a half, as edmondson and mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. honestly, this makes mayall's \"drop dead fred\" seem like \"the godfather\" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. they'd probably enjoy it. pegg and bill nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. mayall and edmondson should not be so lucky. the movie equivalent of chernobyl and should be avoided as such.",

            "it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad.. the acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution. it was completely unoriginal. o, and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger! <br /><br />one of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. if they were hoping for a career relaunch, then i think it might never happen with this on their cv! the script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />i'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.",
            "*spoilers*<br /><br />i don't care what anyone says, this movie is friggin' hilarious. this is the sequel to jack frost, a movie about a killer snowman. the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying dna manipulation chemicals that make human dna bond with dirt, or in this case, snow. the first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him.<br /><br />or so they thought.<br /><br />this movie takes place about a year after the second. some scientists resurrect jack frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. no explanation is ever given for why they do this, they just do. meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested frost in the first is going to the bahamas. unfortunately, the snowman comes with him.<br /><br />this movie has it all. it has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. yes, killer snowballs. they even say \"dada!\" like babies. i'll have to give the makers of this credit. the snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up. i wish that i could get one as a pet. frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns.<br /><br />then there's the actors. there's manners, the fbi agent from the first movie, except here he's wearing an eyepatch. yarr mateys, shiver me timbers, i be an fbi agent! yarrr! and then there's the stereotypical british adventurer and the stereotypical black jamaican with dreadlocks. and finally, captain fun. the fruitiest man on the face of the planet, bar none.<br /><br />this movie isn't scary, but is is hilarious. i laughed my butt off the whole way through, and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good \"bad\" movie.<br /><br />*** out ****",

(sorry for the ambiguity, but i don't want to give anything away) sorry, but it's just not my type of show.",

            "i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think \"dog the bounty hunter\" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of \"high octane\" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?",

            "the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. it is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. if done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time. i'm glad i watched this in class, and not on my own time. i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music. those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. i hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.",

            "hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever cannonite review show. my movie for this week was debatable, what route what movie, what excellent four star epic would i choose, guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route, i've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept. the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman. the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam tiller, eileen seeley as anne tiller, marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners, sean patrick murphy as captain fun, ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost.<br /><br />it's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost(loved the carrot scene),but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast. the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced. what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie?the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder. sam tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original, his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie. his wife however was one of the few bright spots. she played her role as the main woman to a hilt. she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy. the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given. if it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chucky,freddy and jason. laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk, he had humor, and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak.<br /><br />this movie could have been so much more, it could have been a continuation of a great franchise, instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled.<br /><br />this movie gets a two out of ten for me, and it's lucky that it even gets a one.": 2,

            "i have some great memories watching \"robin of sherwood\" on tv as a kid (but i think i only saw michael praed\u00b4s episodes, by some reason). and recently my brother bought the new released dvd-boxes of the complete series. it was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv-series. the cast is great, and the locations mixed with clannad\u00b4s music adds this very special feeling. i personally think that praed is the best of the two robins, but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with. ray winstone, nicolas grace and robert addie is terrific in their roles as will scarlet, the sheriff of nottingham and guy of gisburne. it\u00b4s a pity that a fourth season never got made, and i\u00b4ve also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. robert of huntingdon (connery) could finally have married marion (judi trott), or maybe herne the hunter could resurrect robin of loxley (praed), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. as have been mentioned before; if the producers of \"robin hood: the prince of thieves\" would have been smart, they would have got the cast from \"robin of sherwood\", and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. as ray winstone puts it in the dvd bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in sean connery\u00b4s \"robin and marian\". who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. in any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!": 2,

            "i thought rachel york was fantastic as \"lucy.\" i have seen her in \"kiss me, kate\" and \"victor/victoria,\" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. she is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!<br /><br />i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in \"lucy.\" even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy. my response to that is, \"so what?\" i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy. i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. and rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. i also didn't want to see someone simply \"doing\" classic lucy routines. therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory. (it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). this approach, i thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping, in particular. there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having. i couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.<br /><br />i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of \"i love lucy\" throughout the entire movie. after all, those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years. i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.<br /><br />i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon. and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. \"lucy\" was a star turn for rachel york. i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. i also hope it brings her an emmy.": 2,

            "i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think \"dog the bounty hunter\" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of \"high octane\" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?": 2,

(cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story. avoid this movie at all costs, folks. it's not even an interesting train wreck. (i hope they'll make horton hears a who with robin williams. then we'll have the bad-seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy.)": 2,
            "loved today's show!!! it was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. she is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things, but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down. saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. those who haven't tuned in yet, find out what channel and the time, i assure you that you won't be disappointed.": 4,

            "the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. it is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. if done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time. i'm glad i watched this in class, and not on my own time. i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music. those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. i hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.": 2,
            "the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to john woo's masterful direction, coupled with kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before (tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, i didn't even recognize him at first). sammo's goofy \"buck teeth\" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. jackie chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way. tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.": 2,
            "the movie was excellent, save for some of the scenes with esposito. i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series, and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series (thanks to nbc...). it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human, and most basic persons. braugher and secor did a great job, but as usual will get overlooked. it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide. memories, tapes, and reruns on courttv just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday. but the movie did its job and did it very well, presenting a great depiction of life after al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. i enjoyed this a lot.": 2,

            "the unthinkable has happened. having first witnessed it a few years ago, i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called \"mccinsey's island\". a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones (i'm not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. however, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump \"guest house paradiso\" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch.<br /><br />based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show \"bottom\", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. richard (rik mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. his buddy eddie (director adrian edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. the plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina carbonara (vincent cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso, much to the astonishment of richie and eddie. and... that's it.<br /><br />i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. we've had films like \"trainspotting\", \"28 days later\", \"four weddings and a funeral\" and the brilliant \"shaun of the dead\" (also starring simon pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. \"guest house paradiso\" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. i kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. come the first ad break (it was on tv, you see) and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. \"i'm watching this so they don't have to\" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.<br /><br />trust me, i used to love the \"bottom\" tv show. the combination of suitably grubby acting from mayall and edmondson with ott juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. certainly not for an hour and a half, as edmondson and mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. honestly, this makes mayall's \"drop dead fred\" seem like \"the godfather\" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. they'd probably enjoy it. pegg and bill nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. mayall and edmondson should not be so lucky. the movie equivalent of chernobyl and should be avoided as such.": 2,
            "this film is bundled along with \"gli fumavano le colt... lo chiamavano camposanto\" and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints. first, both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. second, neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though \"il prezzo del potere\" does seem to have a better dub. personally, i always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. these dvd problems, however, are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.<br /><br />as for the film, it's about the assassination of president garfield. this is a major problem, as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland. in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield. he's missing the beard, has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this, i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes. plus, using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho!! he was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.<br /><br />in addition to the stupid casting, president garfield's death was in no way like this film. it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk, not garfield. garfield was shot in washington, dc (not dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. however, according to most experts, what actually killed garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. in other words, like george washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed president garfield was shot.<br /><br />because the film bears almost no similarity to real history, it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. why not also include ninjas, fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it?!?! aside from some decent acting and production values, because the script is utter cow crap, i don't recommend anyone watch it. it's just a complete and utter mess.": 2,

            "*spoilers*<br /><br />i don't care what anyone says, this movie is friggin' hilarious. this is the sequel to jack frost, a movie about a killer snowman. the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying dna manipulation chemicals that make human dna bond with dirt, or in this case, snow. the first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him.<br /><br />or so they thought.<br /><br />this movie takes place about a year after the second. some scientists resurrect jack frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. no explanation is ever given for why they do this, they just do. meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested frost in the first is going to the bahamas. unfortunately, the snowman comes with him.<br /><br />this movie has it all. it has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. yes, killer snowballs. they even say \"dada!\" like babies. i'll have to give the makers of this credit. the snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up. i wish that i could get one as a pet. frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns.<br /><br />then there's the actors. there's manners, the fbi agent from the first movie, except here he's wearing an eyepatch. yarr mateys, shiver me timbers, i be an fbi agent! yarrr! and then there's the stereotypical british adventurer and the stereotypical black jamaican with dreadlocks. and finally, captain fun. the fruitiest man on the face of the planet, bar none.<br /><br />this movie isn't scary, but is is hilarious. i laughed my butt off the whole way through, and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good \"bad\" movie.<br /><br />*** out ****": 29,

            "i thought rachel york was fantastic as \"lucy.\" i have seen her in \"kiss me, kate\" and \"victor/victoria,\" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. she is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!<br /><br />i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in \"lucy.\" even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy. my response to that is, \"so what?\" i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy. i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. and rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. i also didn't want to see someone simply \"doing\" classic lucy routines. therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory. (it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). this approach, i thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping, in particular. there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having. i couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.<br /><br />i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of \"i love lucy\" throughout the entire movie. after all, those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years. i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.<br /><br />i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon. and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. \"lucy\" was a star turn for rachel york. i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. i also hope it brings her an emmy.": 8,

            "i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think \"dog the bounty hunter\" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of \"high octane\" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?": 38,

            "the unthinkable has happened. having first witnessed it a few years ago, i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called \"mccinsey's island\". a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones (i'm not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. however, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump \"guest house paradiso\" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch.<br /><br />based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show \"bottom\", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. richard (rik mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. his buddy eddie (director adrian edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. the plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina carbonara (vincent cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso, much to the astonishment of richie and eddie. and... that's it.<br /><br />i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. we've had films like \"trainspotting\", \"28 days later\", \"four weddings and a funeral\" and the brilliant \"shaun of the dead\" (also starring simon pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. \"guest house paradiso\" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. i kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. come the first ad break (it was on tv, you see) and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. \"i'm watching this so they don't have to\" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.<br /><br />trust me, i used to love the \"bottom\" tv show. the combination of suitably grubby acting from mayall and edmondson with ott juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. certainly not for an hour and a half, as edmondson and mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. honestly, this makes mayall's \"drop dead fred\" seem like \"the godfather\" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. they'd probably enjoy it. pegg and bill nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. mayall and edmondson should not be so lucky. the movie equivalent of chernobyl and should be avoided as such.": 24,
            "this film is bundled along with \"gli fumavano le colt... lo chiamavano camposanto\" and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints. first, both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. second, neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though \"il prezzo del potere\" does seem to have a better dub. personally, i always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. these dvd problems, however, are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.<br /><br />as for the film, it's about the assassination of president garfield. this is a major problem, as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland. in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield. he's missing the beard, has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this, i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes. plus, using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho!! he was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.<br /><br />in addition to the stupid casting, president garfield's death was in no way like this film. it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk, not garfield. garfield was shot in washington, dc (not dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. however, according to most experts, what actually killed garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. in other words, like george washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed president garfield was shot.<br /><br />because the film bears almost no similarity to real history, it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. why not also include ninjas, fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it?!?! aside from some decent acting and production values, because the script is utter cow crap, i don't recommend anyone watch it. it's just a complete and utter mess.": 15,
            "this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and... i stopped caring. this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex. there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment. also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...<br /><br />sounds promising?<br /><br />not really.<br /><br />i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film. basically i started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up.<br /><br />it may work for you, it didn't for me.": 71,
            "this is a typical \"perfect crime\" thriller. a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who guilty is. the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. the result is like every single episode of \"columbo\" or \"murder she wrote\". the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock! this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. skip this one, you are not missing anything.": 58,
            "this is an emperor's new clothes situation. someone needs to say \"that's not a funny and original, (etc., etc.) film; that is an inferior film. don't waste your money on it.\" the film is trashy, and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash. they are all-too-realistically only themselves. they have no lines, they don't act. the american dream is not to create shoddy no-quality films or anything else shoddy and of no-quality; it is to achieve something of quality and, thereby, success. only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood (it can't have been made in hollywood, can it?) would try to impute any kind of quality to this film. it's worse than \"ed woods,\" another film about a film-maker without standards. these films shouldn't have been made, and you shouldn't go see \"american movie.\"": 43,
            "this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability, this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory. whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience, but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. certainly one not to be missed!": 59,
            "this is better then the first. the movie opens up with sheriff sam .then, sam and anne pack there bags up and head to the tropicana while jack tags along.<br /><br />people are shot, get glass through necks, get squished by anvils, get stabbed with icicles, eyes gouged out, head explosions, drownings, hangings, lobsters shoved into faces, slit throats, freezing to death, killed by snowballs, arms are ripped off, melted by anti-freeze, icicles down necks, hit in face with pots and pans, fingers getting' bitten off, icicles through mouths, bitten on the neck, exploding people, toasted snowballs, and shoved in blenders.<br /><br />the snowballs are hilarious, they put it into a blender and turn it on, then it says 'that was fun' they put in in a waffle thing and it gets burnt. <br /><br />this is just a great movie. then they start thinking of other ways to kill it, and the snowball replies, 'that's not nice'<br /><br />it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this.<br /><br />10 out of 10 stars.": 16,
            "this movie has everything typical horror movies lack. although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers. the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for jackzilla. dare i say oscar winner. this is a perfect date movie. i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person.": 31,
            "this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:<br /><br />\"quirky\" and obnoxious characters (a few); \"quirky\" town with \"quirky\" folk; a \"quirky\" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of \"gotta get out of this town\"; downright booooring.<br /><br />and it succeeds on all counts.<br /><br />something to note, though. i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-northern exposure \"quirky\" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. who are they and what the h--- did they have to do with anything? and this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concering kids that seem to span generations. i don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time. huh? what did i miss?<br /><br />avoid. unless for laughs. or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing.": 44,
            "this movie was a rather odd viewing experience. the movie is obviously based on a play. now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch. the movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie. instead what is presented now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play, with over-the-top characters and staged dialog. because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience.<br /><br />it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching. at first you think its a drama you're watching, with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy, that leans really more toward the comedy genre, rather than the drama genre.<br /><br />the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable. sure, the actors are great; peter o'toole and susannah york, amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough'.<br /><br />the story feels totally disorientated. basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york. but what exactly is the story even about? the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. like i said before; i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out.<br /><br />the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences. <br /><br />more was to expect from director j. lee thompson, who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed, stage-play translated to screen, project.<br /><br />really not worth your time.<br /><br />4/10": 55,
            "this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. it is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. it's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.<br /><br />it also borrows from an early cbs game show pioneer- beat the clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome. then it rewards the winner money. if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. <br /><br />this show has elements of several types of successful past programs. reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. if your not, this entire series is as i say, drivel dripping with gravy. it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.<br /><br />it is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet. after all, so do re-runs of gilligan's island, green acres, the beverly hillbillies & the brady bunch. this just doesn't employ professional actors. the intelligence level is about the same.": 6,
            "this show is the worst show ever! norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc etc. the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain? no trees, no building, just whoosh.....thin air. he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. no co star ever gets the glory. its all norris. its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content. terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.": 42,
            "well, the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid. if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you. a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness. i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless. the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. the plot, however, has little to recommend. a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people. but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. not recommended.": 9,
            "when i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. i watched then with very low expectations. now this movie isn't bad per se. you get what you pay for. it is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. definitely not a hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. i would probably never watch this movie again. in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. despite the bad acting, clich\u00e9 lines, and sub par camera work. i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player. the story has been done many times in many movies. this one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /><br />just your average movie.": 5,
            "when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, i know it is bad. i wanted to claw my eyes out. i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to \"unwatch\", if only it were possible. the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat.<br /><br />i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name.<br /><br />to mike myers, i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world. just because it worked for jim carrey, doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians.<br /><br />": 65,
            "wow, i can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.<br /><br />although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk, another great lillard film.<br /><br />baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent d'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)<br /><br />it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme. vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.<br /><br />the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.": 41,
            "wow, this film was terrible. it is as simple as that. it is actually the first time that i walked out early, as far as i can remember. this turned out okay, though: i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a \"movie\".<br /><br />where to start. bad acting, bad jokes. faecal humour, which i simply cannot stand. sorry, but snot, pee and scat are *not* funny. you have seen the title picture? that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two \"heroes\" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be humorous all by itself. it is not.<br /><br />apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, i do not remember much about this. at least not much good. i was really, really disappointed by this piece of garbage. or let us be honest here: given that i am actually a big fan of \"british\" (i.e., black) humour, i was angry.<br /><br />so, want my advice? three words: do not watch.": 64,
            "yes, bad acting isn't only one thing to mention. bad script,not so bad music. unfortunately.<br /><br />nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too.<br /><br />first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea, to have some fun !!! smiling ...<br /><br />they find everything in the sea. i mean things like fishing-net, knife, scuba dive things, ropes, bottles, husband ...<br /><br />woodoo stuff , are you kidding. stupid. they are so happy on the island, they are going to die, and they are happy. love, peace. love. just stupid.<br /><br />terrible, skip this one please.": 49,
            "you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years, right? i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).<br /><br />and i'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable. it's just hard to suspend disbelief for \"bushy bill\" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy.<br /><br />what's the appeal here? i don't care about these people or their meandering lives. i just don't get it. but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy, unwashed people, i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat. they call them homeless people, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking \"pay-dirt\" and fashioning a homemade dr. frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of \"aqua velva\" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. and the best part? much like survivor, every week one member of the tribe \"leaves\" the \"island\" when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear! now that's entertainment!": 4
